            React is a popular JavaScript library used to build user interfaces, particularly for single-page applications. It allows developers to create reusable UI components that efficiently update and render in response to data changes. React uses a virtual DOM to optimize performance, making updates faster by only changing the parts of the page that need to be re-rendered.
<br></br>

Key features of React include:
<ol>
<l1>Component-based architecture: UI is broken into small, reusable components.</l1>
<br></br>
<l1>Declarative syntax: Developers describe what the UI should look like, and React takes care of updating it when the data changes.</l1><br></br>
<l1>Virtual DOM: Improves performance by minimizing direct manipulation of the actual DOM.</l1><br></br>
<l1>Unidirectional data flow: Data flows in one direction, making the app easier to manage and debug.</l1><br></br>
<l1>React is widely used in web development for building interactive and dynamic user interfaces.</l1>
